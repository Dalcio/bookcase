## Summary

- [Live Demo](#live-demo)

## Mandatory Features

- [x] 2 book listings (shelves)
- [x] Allow the change of positions of books by dragging and dropping, being able to be for the same shelf or not.
- [x] When selecting a sort type, and clicking on “Organize” the ordering must be applied to each shelf separately taking into account the books present.
- [x] Reverse the order when clicking the button again, if the same sort option is selected.
- [x] Sort types are: Alphabetical, Size, and Color order
      (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Violet, Pink)
      **Note:** I had to add **magenta** color because the quantity of provided colors doesn't match with all books, missing one book without color (provided 8 color with 9 books. I add the 9nth color). Making the order: **_(Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Violet, Pink, Magenta)_**.
